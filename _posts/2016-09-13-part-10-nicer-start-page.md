# Introduction and requirements

As promised in the [previous part]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-18-part-9-code-refactoring %}) of our tutorial we will now improve the look as well as the functionality of our start page a little bit. Therefore we will 
* add some nice cover images, 
* fetch basic information about the application like it's title and it's description,
* present this data in a hopefully slightly more appealing manner than it is done now,
* and we will add some footer which present some other useful informations and references.

# Playing with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

To improve the look of our application's start page we are going to implement some more element's and features provided by bootstrap. 

## Corousel

To present one or more cover images in some kind of slideshow, we use [Bootstrap's Carousel](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/carousel/) feature. For this we have to rework our current start page **pages/index.html** which looks as follows

```html
<div data-template="templates:surround" data-template-with="templates/page.html" data-template-at="content">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <div class="page-header">
                <h1 data-template="config:app-title">Generated page</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <p>
                    <a data-template="templates:load-source" href="index.html">This</a> is the entry page into your application 
                and was generated by eXide. It uses HTML templates for a clean separation of HTML views and application logic.</p>
                <p>To add your own template functions, start by editing the XQuery module
                <a data-template="templates:load-source" href="modules/app.xql">app.xql</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>The page template uses the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>
                    CSS library for the page layout.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div data-template="app:test"/>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2>Application Info</h2>
            <div data-template="config:app-info"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

The new **pages/index.html** should look like this.

```html
<div data-template="templates:surround" data-template-with="templates/page.html" data-template-at="content">
    <div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
    <!-- Indicators -->
        <ol class="carousel-indicators">
            <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"/>
            <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1"/>
        </ol>
        <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
        <div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
            <div class="item active">
                <img src="$app-root/resources/img/ACDH_Panorama_Postkarte_motiv01.jpg" alt="First" width="1200" height="600" title="by Sandra Lehecka">
                <div class="carousel-caption"/>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img src="$app-root/resources/img/ACDH_Panorama_Postkarte_motiv02.jpg" alt="a nice feature picture" width="1200" height="600" title="by Sandra Lehecka">
                <div class="carousel-caption"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Left and right controls -->
        <a class="left carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" role="button" data-slide="prev">
        <!--<span class="sr-only">Previous</span>--></a>
        <a class="right carousel-control" href="#myCarousel" role="button" data-slide="next">
        <!--<span class="sr-only">Next</span>--></a>
    </div>
</div>
```

In case you are interested in the exact meaning and usage of these elements please refere to [Bootstrap's website](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/carousel/) or go through the [w3schools.com bootstrap tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp). Anyhow, our modification of the **pages/index.html** shows some results. Although one could debate if this kind of change so far could seriously be considered as improvement.

![image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/part-10/image_0.jpg)

As unpleasant the current result is, as predictable it was since the `<img>` elements reference images which do not (yet) exist under the used paths ($app-root/resources/img/ACDH_Panorama_Postkarte_motiv02.jpg). But this is fixed quickly by first creating a `img` directory in `resources` and then uploading images into `/resources/img/`. For this tutorial I will use two images created by [Sandra Lehecka](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/lehecka) but of course feel free to use your own material. Just make sure that the file names of the images match those referenced in the `img` element by the `src` attribute.

![image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/part-10/image_0.jpg)

If you want you can add some descriptions/credits/headlines to those images in the so far empty `<div class="carousel-caption"/>`. In case you want give credits to some images found on wikipedia you could add something like this

```html
<div class="item active">
    <img src="$app-root/resources/img/1200px-Old_book_bindings.jpg" alt="First" width="1200" height="600"/>
    **<div class="carousel-caption">
        <p>
            Von <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Brighterorange" title="User:Brighterorange">Tom Murphy VII</a> - <span class="int-own-work" lang="de">Eigenes Werk</span>, 
            <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, 
            <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=295698">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=295698</a>
        </p>
    </div>**
</div>
```

But be aware that the readability/visibility of those texts highly depend on the images you are using. So it may need some fiddling and playing with all kind of CSS settings to achieve good results.
